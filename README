Lucidpi
-------

This project contains:
* a UDP server that listens for packets of pixel data and puts the data to a Nokia 3310 or 5110 LCD or other LCD using the  PCD8544 chipset. (Written in c)
* a UDP client that sends a packet of pixel data to a listening server. (Written in Ruby)
* a dummy server that listens for packets of pixel data and writes them to the console. Useful for testing clients in the absence of the LCD hardware. (Written in Ruby)

The project requires:
* a Raspberry Pi
* the WiringPi GPIO wrapper library (https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/)
* Nokia 3310 or similar LCD interfaced to the Raspberry Pi GPIO ports
